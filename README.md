# Defense-Surveillance-Robot
A robot for spying border areas for detecting enemy invasion and transmitting this information to the army

This robot consists of two ends, the transmitter end and the receiver end. The transmitter end is placed at the border where surveillance is required. The transmitter consists of a camera which captures the video of the surroundings at the border. It also consists of a GPS (Global Positioning System) module which accurately calculates the location by making use of satellites. The information/data collected by both these elements is processed within a powerful microprocessor, which is also constituting a part of the transmitter end. The final element on the transmitter side is the RF transmitter which is required for wireless communication of the information recorded.

The design of the receiver end is relatively simple and just consists of a corresponding RF receiver which performs the function of decoding the information that it receives. This decoded information must then be displayed to alert the army about the event.
